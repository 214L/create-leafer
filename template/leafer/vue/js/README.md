# Vue 3 + Vite + LeaferJS

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 and LeaferJS in Vite. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs.

Checkout the [LeaferJS](https://www.leaferjs.com/ui/guide/) to learn more about LeaferJS.

Attention : Leafer elements cannot be mounted directly to responsive data, causing layers of internal agents and slowing down the running speed.
